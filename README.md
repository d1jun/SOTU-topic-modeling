# SOTU-topic-modeling
Using topic modeling on a SOTU corpus to analyze a social science research question.

The State of the Union (SOTU) address discusses the current issues facing the country.
With the SOTU address, the President has the opportunity to acknowledge the country’s
accomplishments, current events, the economy, and their legislative proposals. Although the
SOTU is directed at Congress and the American public, it is not an entirely bipartisan address.
This motivates our research question: **“Does the President's political affiliation have an
effect on the policies that they put emphasis on in the SOTU address?”**

Read [this memo](https://github.com/d1jun/SOTU-topic-modeling/blob/main/POLI%20176%20Final%20Project%20Memo.pdf) 
for the analysis of the research question. The memo also describes the approach to answering this 
question as well as the limitations of the approach.
